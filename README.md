# cell-nucleus-1000
Understanding the cell nucleus in all its complexity will require learning the answers to many questions.  But to get started, lets just work on the first 1000.

## How many base pairs does a typical human cell have?
About 3,200,000,000 or 3.2 billion base pairs.

## How many bits are stored in the nuclear DNA of a single human cell?  (Not including any data compression.)
Ignoring metagenomic and epigenomic effects, and leaving out any information theory or data compression possibilities, a single base pair can have four different configurations and so is equivalent to two bits.  A byte is 8 bits, so it takes four base pairs to make a byte.  Since there are about 3.2 billion base pairs in a cell, dividing by four gives a total of 800,000,000 bytes, or 800 MB.  So it's about the size of an old CD-rom.
